        Detail clarification Root cause and resolution
It was 1 month before the graduating day and we left one online test in that day. And it was the first time to test online and all students were afraid of the test. Then we herd the electricity is down and we know if electricity is down Wi-Fi also will down.
The cause of the downing the electricity was the breakdown of the transformer around the university. The main cause of the breakdown of the transformer was wrong configuration of the transformer. 
        How the issue was fixed in detail
The main solution at that time was starting up of the generator. Because if we think about the maintain the electricity power at that time it will take a lot of time. There will be a lot of process .first we will page or trigger the information for the stand by or in call electrical engineers. In that there will be time the engineers notice our acknowledgment or our information. After they know there will be transportation from their home to the broken transformer .and the transportation is always crowded around morning. 
And also take a lot of time for the configuration of the transformer so the test will be delay. For that reason the main solution was starting of the generator to work the WI-FI.
